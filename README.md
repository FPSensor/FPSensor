## Featured Projects

 - [Motorola Moto E5+ kernel upstream](https://github.com/E5Series)    
    - Motorola Moto E5+ comes with a 3.18 kernel and I added support for kernel 4.9 to extend Android updates beyond the Android 12 eBPF limits for 3.18 kernels 
 - [Mi 8 kernel upstream](https://github.com/dipper-419)    
    - The Xiaomi Mi 8 comes with a 4.9 kernel and i updated it to 4.19 to provide morefeatures and faster UI    
    - This kernel only worked in recovery mode and never fully booted due to missing resources (Phone dead)    
 - [Proton+ development](https://github.com/ProtonKernel)    
    - Proton+ is a Kernel for the Galaxy S21Series and Galaxy A52q/a72q    
    - I developed for the Galaxy S21Series kernel with some contribs    
    - On Galaxy A52/A72 i did a lot of changes and most of users report a very good improvment saying tht its the best kernel fot that devices    
 - I did some other apports but these are not such that i can link to       

Supported devices:

 - **IPhone 11 Pro Max** no development lol    
 - **Motorola Moto G100 [nio]**
 - **Samsung Galaxy A52/A72 [a52q/a72q]** [only by Proton+ dev]
 - **Samsung Galaxy S21FE [r9s]** [only by Proton+ dev]     
 - **Xiaomi Redmi 14C [lake]** [don¬¥t develop on it for now]    

‚ö†Ô∏è I do not maintain public builds at the moment.  

I currently don't have a working PC due to a motherboard failure. Once repaired, I plan to return to active development.

Also i have a Redmi 4X that i can`t unlock, a old LG F60 and a Huawei P8 Lite.
But these are useless

if You want me to add another device to this list u have two options:
1. Send me the device or money to buy it [Donation]
2. Wait to see if i add the device [So I buy the device myself]

## üì¨ I'm open to opportunities

I'm currently looking to collaborate with developers or contribute to Android-related projects.  
Feel free to reach out through email or Telegram if you think we can build something together!
